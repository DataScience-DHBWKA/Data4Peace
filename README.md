This repository contains a detailed analysis and comparison of Jupyter Notebook (Python) and Power BI.
For this, we have used a temporal 🕔 and geographical 🗺 dataset about terrorism to compare the features, functionality, and capabilities of these extensive tools.
You can find the detailed elaboration 📑 in the [Elaboration.pdf]() (note, that the current version is only avaiable in German. Other Versions may follow soon.)

## [Dataset: Global Terrorism Database - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd)
"The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland."
